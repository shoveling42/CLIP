# Finetuning-CLIP
This repository is for COSE474 final project. The topic will be about finetuning and zero-shot prediction.

Because of storage issue, I had no choice but to utilize Indo fashion dataset rather than Korean.

Therefore, I cannot fully interpret qualitative results of zero-shot classification.
